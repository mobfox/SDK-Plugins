Install Xamarin
===============

1. Create an account: 
   https://www.xamarin.com

2. Download installer: 
   https://www.xamarin.com/download

   Also download Sharpie: 
   https://download.xamarin.com/objective-sharpie/ObjectiveSharpie.pkg

3. Building the plugin:

   A. Building iOS part of the plugin: 

      ** ‘MobFoxSDKCoreForXamarin’ folder:

      A copy of the MobFoxSDKCore is at ‘MobFoxSDKCoreForXamarin’
      Copy the .m and .h files, etc.
      The project is a wrapper around the original MobFoxSDKCore to create a
      static library out of it. After you build the project, copy the 
      ‘libMobFoxSDKCore.a’ file into ‘MobFoxSDKCoreStaticLibrary’ folder

      ** ‘MobFoxSDKCoreStaticLibrary’ folder:

      After you build the project, copy the ‘libMobFoxSDKCore.a’ file into
      ‘MobFoxSDKCoreStaticLibrary’ folder, and make sure the .h files inside
      ‘include’ folder are up to date.

       Now run the ‘make.sh’ script.

      This will create 2 new files in ‘MobFoxSDKCore’: 
      ApiDefinitions.cs & StructsAndEnums.cs

      Rename these to:
      ApiDefinition.cs & Structs.cs

      In both files comment out any line starting with “[Verify…”

      In ‘ApiDefinition.cs’ - search for every line starting with
      “// @protocol XXX <NSObject>” (e.g. “// @protocol MobFoxNativeAdDelegate <NSObject>”)
      and add above it a line like:
      “public interface IXXX { }” (e.g. “public interface IMobFoxNativeAdDelegate { }”)
      (note - in the added line you add an “I” before the object name)

      Copy the ApiDefinition.cs & Structs.cs & libMobFoxSDKCore.a files to folder
      ‘AppleBinding’ inside the ’MobFoxAds’ folder.

   B. Building the Android part of the plugin:

      Copy the latest Android MobFox-Android-SDK-Core-***.JAR file into
      ‘JarBinding/Jars’ folder inside the ‘MobFoxAds’ folder.

   C. Packing the whole plugin:
      
      Open ‘MobFoxAds.sln’ solution file from inside the ‘MobFoxAds’ folder.
      
      Build the project.

      Run the ‘make.sh’ script. It will create the ‘MobFox.Plugin.MobFoxAds.1.0.12.nupkg’
      file which is the plugin.

      Note: the version info is defined in the ‘Plugin.MobFoxAds.nuspec’ file.

4. Demo application:

   A. It is in the ‘MobFoxDemoXM’ folder. Open the ‘MobFoxDemoXM.sln’ solution file.

   B. Copy the ‘MobFox.Plugin.MobFoxAds.1.0.12.nupkg’ file from the ‘MobFoxAds’ folder
      into the ‘packages’ folder of ‘MobFoxDemoXM.sln’

      Build the project, and run.
