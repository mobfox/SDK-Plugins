Building the Unity plugin:
==========================

A. Building iOS part of the plugin: 

	** ‘Assets/Plugins/iOS’ folder:

	Copy the latest 'MobFoxSDKCore.framework' to the ‘Assets/Plugins/iOS’ folder
	under the Unity project folder (for our demo app it is the 'MobFox-Unity-Demo' folder)
      
	The 'MobFoxUnityPlugin.h' & 'MobFoxUnityPlugin.mm' are the plugin implementation.
	These are the files you can edit to make changes in the Unity iOS plugin.

B. Building the Android part of the plugin:

	** ‘Assets/Plugins/Android’ folder:

	Copy the latest 'MobFox-Android-SDK-Core-X.X.X.jar' to the ‘Assets/Plugins/Android/libs’
	folder under the Unity project folder (for our demo app it is the 'MobFox-Unity-Demo' folder)

	The GIT has a folder called 'MobFox-Android-Unity-Plugin'. This is an Android Studio
	project that generates the Android part of the Unity plugin.
      
	You can edit the code in this project, and then build it.
      
	After you build it, run the 'exportJar' script from within the Android Studio project.
	It will create the file 'mobfox-android-unity-plugin.jar' file under
	'app/build/outputs' folder.
      
	Copy this file to the ‘Assets/Plugins/Android/libs’ folder under the Unity project
	folder (for our demo app it is the 'MobFox-Unity-Demo' folder)
